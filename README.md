As I progress learning things about software engineering, I compiled all the tools and technologies that are notable for me.
I also shared my career history and experience through the years of challenges in the industry.

### Archived Files

- [archives](archives/): The location where I put or stored some of my notable documentation about software engineering.

### Restore

- Since user and organization github page needed to be in the master branch, the files from the root directory are expected to merge with the build files generated by the tools used for each version.

- To restore files and directories to original common files that are listed above, execute the command below:

  ```text
  ./pre-deployment.sh
  ```
