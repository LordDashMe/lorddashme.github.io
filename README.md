As I continue to learn about software engineering, I've compiled all of the tools and technologies that have stood out to me on this website. I also shared some of my experiences in the said industry in the format of gists or tidbits.

## Common Files

```text

```

### Archived Files

- [archives](archives/): The location where I put or stored some of my notable documentation about software engineering.

### Restore

- Since the user and organization account type in github page needed to be deployed in the master branch, the files from the root directory are expected to merge with the build files generated by the tools used for each version.

- To restore files and directories to original common files that are listed above, execute the command below:

  ```text
  ./pre-deployment.sh
  ```
