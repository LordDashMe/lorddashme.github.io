As I delve deeper into the realm of software engineering, I've curated a comprehensive collection of tools and technologies that have markedly resonated with me, all showcased on this platform. Additionally, I've interspersed my journey with insights and narratives from my industry experience, presented as succinct gists and insightful tidbits.

### Archived Files

- [archives](archives/): The location where I put or stored some of my notable documentation about software engineering.

### Restore

- Since the user and organization account type in github page needed to be deployed in the master branch, the files from the root directory are expected to merge with the build files generated by the tools used for each version.

- To restore files and directories to original common files that are listed above, execute the command below:

  ```text
  ./pre-deployment.sh
  ```
